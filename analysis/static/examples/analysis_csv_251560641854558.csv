First I want the code work by finding a contract number or serial.
 
My code is:

import csv

with open(""C:\\Users\\id984876\\PycharmProjects\\Search Engine SMC\\CA-10-60.csv"") as csv_File:
    reader = csv.DictReader(csv_File)

    R = input(""What line do you need?:  "")
    i = reader

    for row in reader:
        if row['Contract'] == R:
            print(row['Contract'])
        else: print(""Number doesn't exist"")
        break

Outcome in PyCharm:
What line do you need?: 13018:001
13081:001

This is the outcome when I put in a contract number from the csv file. When I put in another contract number from the same file it says: Number doesn't excist.

Which is strange...even when I change if row['Serial'] and print(row['Serial']) and put in an excisting serial, I get the same result.

One: Why does it find only one contract number?
Two: Why deosn't he find a excisting serial?

Example:
A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
A ** 2
.
>>> 
array([[ 7, 10],

The problem is that I am unable to read the file completely. Different encoding techniques being used by me to read the data but every time data is partially read. I already tried latin-1, utf 8,16,32 and 64 and also tried ascii. These all encoding techniques are reading partial data from the file.
I have to read data from my research experiments. May any of guys suggest me what should I do?

1. Open the File with ndimage.imread(fname)
2. Get RGB from n dimensional matrix
3. Modify some elements of R matrix
4. Save the new image with jpeg extension using scipy.misc.imsave.

The question is: Why is not the new image saved?

To check out the changes I use matlab and I can see the new values is not saved.

Besides, I have seen that the new values only are saved when the image is saved with png extension.

could someone please help me out with Python script on Debian machine?
I am putting together a web crawler and it is working ok for now, but I feel there is some space for improvement.
1. The problem is that the crawler slows down twice every hour.. Im not entirely sure about the Worker and the Pool part, but the bottleneck seems to be the link_list variable that holds all sites to be crawled. It grows up to 300k in a few hours.
I could not think of the solution for this, other than a database. Ive tried to connect to MySQL on the same machine, but PyMySQL could not connect to it (some weird auth issue maybe, tcp and socket). Would using database instead of large var solve speed decrease problem?
2. Also if I kill the script in the teminal in any way (Ctrl+C) some threads remain runing (I can see it in htop). I there an easy way to kill it from the main process on close?

602,"Here's a fun challenge:

Implement a program that produces the see and say sequence.

The see and say sequence is as follows:
Each item is how you say the previous item when counting the kinds of digits from left to right. The sequence is primed with 1.

So, the first item is 1. There's one 1.

That means the second item is 11.

see_and_say = [1, 11]

The second item is two 1s. So the the item is 21.

see_and_say = [1, 11, 21]

The third item has one 2 followed by one one. So the fourth item is 1211.

see_and_say = [1, 11, 21, 1211]

And so on and so forth forever.

Bonus points:
*Make it lazy
*Implement slicing
*Have an optional argument to prime the sequence with a number other than one
*Have an optional keyword argument to make the numbers read from right to left rather than left to right

758,"Hi, folks :-)

We just finished one project and we have five senior developers on our team with ML and A.I. experience, ready to jump on new projects.

Let me introduce us shortly. We are an independent group of senior developers, who left huge corporations so we can work on projects we enjoy. We are working on some A.I. and Machine Learning projects now. Four of us are Ph.D.'s in Machine Learning and Mathematics.

Our Stack:

Clojure, ClojureScript, Python (Keras, TensorFlow), AWS, JS, Machine Learning, Node.Js, PHP, Angular, C# (.NET Core), PostgreSQL, ReactJS, Scala, Presto, Docker, Linux and many others.

Here are some projects we are working on:
www.discomelee.com
www.foldapp.com
www.evolta.fi
Stealth startup - Machine Learning platform for forex trading

Ideally, we are looking for long-term cooperation, we don't like to switch between projects too often. We are based in the Czech Republic and we work mostly with start-ups as co-developers.

We launched our facebook page - Flexiana. You can have a look at projects we are working on right now.

Also, would like to connect with other ML and A.I. experts to share knowledge and ideas. We teach at universities, so always happy to help with anything related to software development:)

I was working on a program in Python, but I want to convert it into Java. and my program has two functions and I implement the first function in the second one. 

So here is the Python code:
https://pastebin.com/SxPHMR9y

If you can realize in the link, the first function is literally inside the second one, but I know in Java each Method will be separate and I already succeeded in converting the first function. 

However, my problem is in the second one, because I am supposed to generate some numbers from that function and I used to use a list when using a Python, but in Java the professor told us not to use a list, and just print the numbers so I don't really know how to do that?

Anyways here is my code so far:
https://pastebin.com/CErk352n

As I said I finished the first one, and I almost finished the second one, but I need someone to help me with printing the numbers using other way other than list.

DNA Sequencing:

The term DNA sequencing refers to methods for determining the order of the nucleotide bases, adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine in a molecule of DNA. The standard representation of the bases is to use their first letters, ATCG, so that DNA is represented as a string using only those four characters. However, DNA strings are millions of bases (characters) long.
Substring matching is the process of determining whether a shorter string (the substring) is contained within a longer string. Substring matching plays important roles in the reconstruction of an unknown DNA string from pieces and in searching for interesting
substrings within a known DNA string.
Python provides a find(substring, start, end) string method that returns the lowest index (integer) where the substring is found in the index range start ≤ index <
end. The start and end arguments are optional, but for this exercise we will make them required. If the substring is not found, -1 is returned.

(a) Without using the find string method, write a function that behaves exactly like the find string method. As your function is not a string method, the string to search must be an argument—let’s make it the first one. The resulting format of your function will be:
            find(some_string, substring, start, end)
For example, if some_string is ‘ACGTCGA’ and ‘substring’ is ‘CG’, your find function should return 1.

(b) Biology researchers frequently want to find all the locations where a substring is found, not simply the first one. Write a function named multi_find(some_string, substring, start, end) that, instead of returning one integer index, returns a string that contains zero or more indices separated by commas. In this case, the string will contain digits representing the integer indices. If the substring is not found, an empty string is returned. You may use the find method that you wrote earlier.
For example, if some_string is ‘ACGTCGA’ and ‘substring’ is ‘CG’, your find function should return ‘1,4’.",2017-08-15 23:33:25,Salma Michael,15,14,1,0,0,0,0,2,0

938,"ATTENTION PLEASE!

Hey guys! I am working on a project, and I am almost finished but there is one small thing that I can't figure out. I need to generate a table of  monthly payments for mortgage. I did the maths, I did everything, it is just that there is a small requirement which is I have to do the numbers right justified so that the table look good.

So I tried to do it in a nice way by using ""\t""

Here is the link of my trial and it looks fine, please have a look at the final program by running the code:

use these numbers to make it easy to see the final program:

Enter the Mortgage Amount in Dollars: $1000
Enter the Annual Interest Rate: %10
Enter the No. of Years for the Loan Period: 1

https://pastebin.com/V4ZdaFt2

But that's what not the professor wants, he wants it to be right justified. So I had a way which I used before to right justify strings and if you could see, I used it when generating the Payment No. and I tried on the interest, principal, and balance, but it doesn't work and idk why?????????? It just generates irregular shape.

Here is my trial to right justify, please open and run it:

https://pastebin.com/z5AviL1W

The only difference between my first trial and second trial is at the end of the loop which I introduced some variables to change interest, principal, and balance to string type and changed lines 39, 40 accordingly.

I am sure all the problem are in lines 39, 40 or maybe in the loop, so please see what's wrong I have?

My goal is to make it right justified like the picture I uploaded so please tell me what is the problem????!!!!!!! :( :( :(",2017-08-11 05:30:46,Salma Michael,21,21,0,0,0,0,0,10,0

Thanks for having me here. However, I'm a proper novice and beginner in Programming and I'm starting with python so I need assistance with solutions to some basic problems in python. Please find below the questions:

1. Write a program in python that accepts a number between 0-9 as argument. This function should then return the word representation of the number.

2. Using Python, write a function that accepts a String argument and prints the String converted to uppercase.

3. What will be the output of this code snippet?print “I love programming” [1:-5]

4.Write a program in python that accepts a number between 0-9 as argument. This function should then return the word representation of the number.
Your answer

5. Write a function fizzbuzz , this function should take a number as an argument. The function should return “fizz” if the number is divisible by 3, but should return “buzz” if divisible by 5. If divisible by both 3 and 5, it should return “fizzbuzz”.

6. Create a class RECTANGLE (in Python), this class should define a constructor that initializes two properties: length and breadth. This class should also have the following methods:- setLength(length) ------->This can be used to set the length property of the object. getLength() ------> This can be used to retrieve the length of the object. setBreadth(breadth) ----- This can be used to set the breadth property of the object. getBreadth() -------> This can be used to get the breadth property of the object. calculateArea() -----> This will calculate and return the area of the rectangle object. printArea() ------> This will calculate and print the area of the rectangle object

You know guys, Google is a good place to ask, “Where can I learn programming because I’m so freaking in to it?” If someone will just comment ‘google’ to your post, don’t think anything bad about that because Google is really one of the ways. And please, why not consult Google first. It can give you more detailed information that will lead you to your learning path. So, happy learning to all of you. Visit python.org and read the tutorial from its documentation, from there you can learn the basics of python and you won’t be needing a tutor unless your understanding is that strong. And don’t be lazy, let me just be the one :).",2017-08-03 13:23:53,Denniel Luis Saway Sadian,54,52,1,1,0,0,0,15,0

I am writing a code in which the user needs to input values in three different QlineEdits, so that the calculation (triggered by the button start) can continue. What I am trying to do is the following:

1 - Store the values of the three QlineEdits into a list;
2 - Use the list to check if there is any field that was not filled;
3 - Show an error QMessageBox saying that at least one QlineEdit does not have an input.

I know it might be a simple task, but I have been struggling with it for a while. I would greatly appreciate if you could provide me with some insights. In advance, thank you very much.

If you have a function that can take keyword arguments, but you don't know which ones you'll want to pass it in advance, you can build a dictionary of them like so:

kwargs = {}
kwargs['foo'] = 5
kwargs['bar'] = ""All your base are belong to us!""
kwargs['baz'] = 3.14159

and then pass it to the function like this:

keyword_function(**kwargs)

I did that here is my code: https://pastebin.com/mX11eRey
The 2nd part: I cannot get that. Make a script the also makes the user enter a year and then reports when the next leap year will occur?
It says make use of part 1 so I assume I will have to continue on part 1 and we cannot use loops, because we didn't take that yet. And a leap year doesn't always happen each 4 years, read the picture I attached.

1207,"Question time... 

I have decided to study and stick with only Python (since I don't have the time to learn all the numerous other languages), but I have some questions. 

1. Is it possible to create applications with customised GUI (like the one shown in the image below) using only Python? I only see stuff which look like the standard Microsoft Windows graphics whenever I do a search on Python GUI.

2. How deep is Python in the area of music production? Is it possible to create applications like digital audio workstation (like the one shown in the image below), MIDI sequencers, music notation software, etc? I'm into music, but none of the existing music applications seem to provide the tools I need in a music application software and I therefore wish to create something more specific to my needs. Is it possible to achieve this using only Python? 

3. What is the purpose of turtle apart from drawing caricatures in IDLE?

The rar file is composed of two files which are the ""hangman.pyw"" and the ""py.png"", program will not run unless ""py.png"" is present in the same directory where the ""hangman.pyw"" is placed. The script ends with "".pyw"" so that no console will pop-up whenever the script will run. I used tkinter and turtle in writing this project. The python version used is 3.6.2. The OS used is windows 10. This is an object-oriented program that consists of one class named ""HangMan"" and this class contains 31 methods. I didn't compile it to an executable so that you can edit things in it. If it doesn't run in your system, comment here something about the problem.

No one was saying: ""Hey, let’s do Node.""

But that didn't stop Mac Heller-Ogden, senior developer at Cars.com. 

He knew management wasn't warm on the idea, so he built a proof-of-concept to test out Node.js on his own time.

Mac is now the principal developer at Cars.com.  The site is also almost completely on Node.js.

We covered his story of convincing his entire company to do a full node migration, what the benefits were, and how he felt about taking on this risky initiative.

1412,"For complete beginners who want to learn PYTHON, Before learning python, have an idea about what are all the things you can do using Python. Here are the few common cool things listed.

->Web Development : You can develop a website with a backend supporting REST api using python frameworks such as DJANGO/FLASK.
->Game Development : You can develop a video game using a python module PYGAME.
->Computer Vision : You can do interesting thongs such as face detection, color detection using OPENCV with python.
->Web Scarping : If you want to get data from a website but the website doesn't have an API to expose data, you can use python modules REQUESTS, SCRAPY, BEAUTIFULSOUP to support web scraping.
->Machine Learning : You can do cool things such as predicting stocks, finger print identification, spam detection etc.,using machine learning. Python has modules SCIKIT-LEARN, THEANO, TENSORFLOW to support it. currently Deep Learning has all the hype and TENSORFLOW has support for Deep Learning.
->GUI Development : To develop a cross-platform desktop application, python has modules TKINTER, PYQT to support it.
->Robotics : Raspberry Pi can be used as a brain to the robot to perform various actions and to react to the environment and the coding on a Raspberry Pi can be done using Python.
->Data Analysis : Data whenever obtained either online or offline would not be properly formatted with various issues such as missing values etc., This data can be cleaned(formatted in a proper sequence) using python module PANDAS. and to visualize the data, python module MATPLOTLIB can be used.
->Browser Automation : Cool things such as opening a browser and posting a facebook status can be done using SELENIUM with python.

and the list goes on but above are the very common things in the real world.

1504,"Flask-OAuthlib to implement OAuth implicit flow:

Is it feasible to implement oauth provider implicit flow using Flask-OAuthlib? I have been trying this for more than a week now, can't share codes because of some internal company policy. My issue is OAuthlib has every thing predefined--from what arguments to pass to type of arguments.--And, most of these are not even needed in the implicit flow. If I try to work around these, it starts throwing multiple errors. As long as I have OAuthlib decorators on, I'm not allowed to bypass these API internals. And some how I feel the Flask-OAuthlib is skewed towards authorization flow. please, provide your point of view. because I'm definitely missing something.

(your Gmail is protected once your Gmail falls the rest falls with it use a long password with caps and special characters and numbers 24-26 is suggested but 8-12 should do but it can be broken at that length try using phrases you'll remember and mix some caps special characters in there and numbers and keep up-to-date on software updates and any Google alerts and beware of phishing attempt.)
