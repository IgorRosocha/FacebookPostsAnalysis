Why should I use FacebookPostsAnalysis?
========================================

Have you ever wondered how actively users of a **Facebook** group/page you want to join, or you are a part of, respond to the others posts? Which posts are the most popular ones, and which get the most negative feedback? Wouldn't it be nice to just automatically analyze the data about all of the posts, in a comprehensive way?

That's the purpose of **FacebookPostsAnalysis**! This application gathers Facebook open group/page data for semantic analysis, and then automatically generates a **Jupyter Notebook** containing the analysis of its posts. You can specify the time period and which open group/page to analyze.

The **Jupyter Notebook** analysis contains information about:

	- Total number of posts (within the specified time period),
	- Most popular posts (based on total number of reactions),
	- Posts with the highest number of Likes/Shares/Comments,
	- Most unpopular posts (based on total number of Angrys/Sads),
	- Months with the biggest activity of users (based on total number of reactions and comments), displayed in a graph.
