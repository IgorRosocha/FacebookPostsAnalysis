Welcome to FacebookPostsAnalysis!
==================================

Introduction
-------------

**FacebookPostsAnalysis** is a Python 3.6 application to analyze the posts of a **Facebook** page or open group - total number of reactions, most liked posts, activity of users, and much more. All of the posts are exported into a .csv file, which can be opened with your preferred spreadsheet software, and then automatically analyzed using **Jupyter Notebook**.

For more information, please check the sections below. I recommend you to start by `Why should I use FacebookPostsAnalysis <general.html#section>`__ section, and then head over to `Installation <installation.html#section>`__.
